# ⚠️ ARCHIVED AND ABANDONED ⚠️

I never finished this. No further work will be done here. This is not a place of honor.

The good news is, that I finally started over, with [doorman](https://github.com/jordemort/doorman).

Original README follows:

## hodoor

hodoor lets Linux users play old DOS BBS games. It is written in Python 3.

This code is at a very early "minimum viable product" stage. Batteries and instructions not yet included.
